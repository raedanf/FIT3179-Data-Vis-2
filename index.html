        <p class="lato-regular">

            Australia is divided into 6 States and 2 Territories. These 
            areas differ greatly in Size, Population and Economic 
            status. This visualisation will explore the differences 
            between the States and Territories and how Australia has 
            evolved over time.

                        Although the populations in each region can 
                        range from a few hundred thousand to multiple
                        millions, the proportion of sexes in each 
                        region is generally consistent across each 
                        state and territory.

                        Looking at the spread of population in terms 
                        of age instead of region shows that although 
                        the proportion of Males and Females is very 
                        similar for younger age groups, in the more 
                        senior groups, women far outnumber men. The 
                        majority of people in Australia are millenials,
                        with the population decreasing in older and 
                        younger age groups.

                        The differences in populations and sizes 
                        of regions in Australia is most evident 
                        in this plot. As the chart on the left 
                        shows, regions such as the ACT are 
                        incredibly dense with around 200 people 
                        per square kilometer. Conversely, the 
                        Northern Territory is sparsely populated, 
                        having less than 1 person for every 5 
                        square kilometers.

                        Using a log scale for the populations 
                        of each region, we can better see the 
                        trends in the state populations. 
                        Generally the populations of states and 
                        territories grow consistently, with the 
                        only exceptions to this trend being the 
                        population of the ACT slowly approaching 
                        the population of Tasmania and Victoria's 
                        population having a slight reduction 
                        during the pandemic; possibly due to 
                        lockdowns.

                        The majority of Australia's GDP comes from 
                        the Eastern and Western states, with the central 
                        regions having much lower GSPs. This is also 
                        affected by the populations of each region, as 
                        a more populated region will generally have a 
                        higher GSP. When looking at GSPs per capita, 
                        it becomes clear that Western Australia and the 
                        Northern Territory have the highest GSPs when, 
                        adjusting for their population size.

            Each Australian State and Territory is unique, 
            with each region varying greatly in size, 
            population demographics and economic output.

        </p>

        <p class="lato-regular">

            Over time, with the country progressing and 
            changing at its current rate, the demographics 
            and populations of each region will continue to 
            provide interesting trends and patterns to analyse.
